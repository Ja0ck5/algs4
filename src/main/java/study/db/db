###  一张表最多能存多少数据

```text
An InnoDB tablespace also has a limit on table size of 64 terabytes. How many rows fits into this depends on the size of each row.

The 64TB limit assumes the default page size of 16KB. You can increase the page size, and therefore increase the tablespace up to 256TB. But I think you'd find other performance factors make this inadvisable long before you grow a table to that size.
```

根据 page 页大小而定，默认 16KB 则 64T, 如果调整页大小最大能到 265T
